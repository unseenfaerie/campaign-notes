            <p>Overview</p>
            <h2>Pantheon</h2>
            <p>Three Sister Goddesses</p>
            <h2>Alignment and Ethos</h2>
            <p>Wyaris is Chaotic Good. She represents the reckless selflessness that people can undertake. Of the Three
                Sisters, Wyaris is the most tenacious. She embodies the ugency of "NOW!".</p>
            <h2>Spheres Granted</h2>
            <p>War, </p>
            <h2>Associations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>[Danaris, Lady of Death] - Sister</li>
                <li>[Vaharis, Lady of Judgement] - Sister</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Main Sects</h2>
            <h3>The [Winged Blades of Wyaris]</h3>
            <p>Die-hard zealots of the Dancing Blade form passed down by Wyaris. Their edict is to go out amongst the
                people and ensure that good is done, laws be damned. Most common people are heartened to see them,
                especially on the road where their presence reduces ambushes by [Wyvernfang].</p>
