            <h2>Time In Game</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h2>DM Summary</h2>
            <p>Approximately 200 years after the fall of Vokdjinn...</p>
            <p>A new adventuring party takes shape. [Rel], [Durchir], [Alann], and [Cormac] come to Othlorin from Gatûn.
                Some
                seek the riches that lie in the ruins of the old elven homeland. They settle into [Wavethorn], a
                merchant's city on the edge of the sea. Before long, they are suspected of murder. Their confidant
                [Bert]
                Verinwort is later framed for a demonic ritual murder of several prominent figures in town, including
                his uncle Phil Verinwort. After being kidnapped by Wyvernfang bandits, the party understands the
                conspiracy to remove political threats to those that the Wyvernfang have installed on the council. Brae
                Novan and Daniel Hillstop are connected to the gang. After gathering evidence against these parties, the
                party clears a nearby dungeon of Wyvernfang and uses a massive amount of money they found to bankroll a
                coup of the government. The coup succeeds and a new, more balanced, three-council-oligarchy is
                implemented by [Bert]. This endeavor was made possible by an underground crime lord named [Gereg]. Due
                to
                his involvement, the party was obliged to put him into power on the Mercantile council. Brae and Daniel
                escaped execution by fleeing the town before the new regime was enacted.</p>

            <h2>[Alann]'s Notes</h2>
            <p>Day 1 - Arrival at [Wavethorn]</p>
            <p>A gigantic lighthouse comes into view, heavily fortified. Fit with cannons. This city seems well-defended
                and must have a good governmental system. Group up with a band of three. Invae greets us. One silver for
                a tour. I pay it. We go on tour. [Wavethorn]
                is lead by six bloodline elders. They make the laws. [Ponat] worshippers fortify the city. Outskirts and
                docks are assumed crime hubs. Force a young woman to look through a book for lodging pricing. Cassia and
                [Idona] heathen (young woman). Drink at the Lucky Badger with the party and Invae. [Bert Verinwort] is a
                suspect for the recent
                disappearances. Nephew of Phil Verinwort. Phil may have been killed by [Bert]. Pay 3 silver for lodging.
                Travel on the morrow to the council to investigate the disappearances with [Rel], [Durchir], [Cormac],
                and
                Invae. I go to bed at the inn, pray first for (Command, also Command)</p>
            <p>Day 2 - Lucky Badger</p>
            <p>Woken up by the guards. Invae is missing, we are suspected. Questioned by the council, [Cormac] is
                missing,
                I suspect him. We go free. Go to market, looking for [Cormac]. Find [Cormac], go to council, [Cormac] is
                arrested. [Bert] was extra suspicious. Head back to Lucky Badger. Run into older council woman. Invae is
                her daughter and betrothed to [Bert].</p>
            <p>Day 3 in City</p>
            <p>Go to see Doh at the combined church. Donate 25gp. This morning [Cormac] came back. He dislikes me. Go
                back
                to Lucky Badger to meet up with group. [Bert] has a demonic altar, dead people, bandits of the
                Wyvernfang
                leaving his home. Once dies by choking,
                other one is unconscious. [Bert] had seemed suspicious. Phil, Invae, and Daré are in a notebook with
                plans
                for their deaths. We plan on staying in his house. (2 Command spells). We will interrogate him with
                these spells. Go to bed.</p>
            <p>Day 4 in City</p>
            <p>Imprisoned and suspected for murder of a council member. Knocked out by the ring guy. At zero health.</p>
            <p>Assuming Day 5 - HP: 1</p>
            <p>Chained in dungeon. [Rel] presumed dead. Invae in dungeon. Other girls as well. We bust out. Don't save
                Invae. Escape ruins, [Rel] injured and unconscious. We hide out in woods.</p>
            <p>Day 6? - HP:2</p>
            <p>Stay night in the woods. Still don't have Stuff. Meet up with [Durchir] on his work day. Hide in his log
                cart. Prepare CAUSE LIGHT WOUNDS. Make it into the city. Go to Lucky Badger. We are wanted for killing
                [Bert]. Death Penalty. Going back to get Stuff from prison. Prepare Command spell. We get caught. Go to
                prison. [Cormac] will break us out. By the way, [Bert] is alive and we took him to the Badger. I prepare
                two
                Cause Darkness spells. [Cormac] broke out of his cell. Gone for some time. Comes back to cell. Guards
                run
                past. Leaves cell. Time
                passes.</p>
            <p>Day 7</p>
            <p>10:30 AM: Get busted out, feel bad about it. In woods. Prepare Fear spell. Hang out for a while. Meet up
                with the crew minus [Durchir]. [Cormac] goes to find him. Evening, [Durchir] comes back. I want to
                challenge
                Ring Guy to 1 on 1 combat. [Rel] says they will not heed me. We go to Wyvern Mausoleum. [Cormac] goes
                and
                tries to open the door, the fool. He comes back, smart. Guy comes out, [Cormac] misses utterly with a
                crossbow. I cast Darkness, it doesn't work. We wait more and learn the secret knock. We wait to enter
                when someone is expected. We kill a guy. We go in. We investigate. There is a room with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A pile of dead spiders 3 inches tall. Large spiders.</li>
                <li>Egg sac pile.</li>
                <li>Unspun web pile.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It seems like they were milking spiders for their web.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Pile of rust.</li>
                <li>Bits of charcoal.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>[Cormac] suggests that they are magical components. There was a fight, we take down six enemies. [Cormac]
                is
                down, just unconscious. Cast Cure Light Wounds on him, he's back. Explore more. Go back through secret
                passage. Free Invae. [Bert] and her are hiding in passage. We are exploring. We go into an unexplored
                area. [Cormac] and I were knocked unconscious by a terrifying force. We have been
                discovered. We are escaping. Everyone down, I am healing them. We escape.</p>
            <p>Assuming Day 8</p>
            <p>The sun rises as we escape the bloody dungeon. We go to the woods to rest. We do. HP: 4. We go to the
                Lucky Badger at sundown to convene. Party decides to go talk to [Gereg] for information. I stay behind
                to
                watch Invae. I am supremely uncomfortable with this. I rest. HP: 5</p>
            <p>Day 9</p>
            <p>Spending the day in the tavern. Rest of the party is out and about. I owe [Gereg] a significant amount of
                money. We are planning to put a new regime in place.</p>
            <p>Day 10</p>
            <p>Getting ring from [Leo] the curator to get gold from mausoleum to pay off city guard to stage a coup. I
                go
                to pray at the temple. I get a new spell called ENFORCE HONOR that forces single combat. NIGHT: We are
                going to the mausoleum. Spider evidence around, lots and lots of gold. Tiny spiders, we take the gold.
                We make it to woods camp.</p>
            <p>Day 11</p>
            <p>It was 119,112gp. This must get back to the city coffers. I make 23,822gp. [Bert] and [Durchir] go to
                convince the public. We will get the guards and common people on our side to place a new regime.
                [Durchir]
                goes to bribe the guard captain. The revolution will happen on Friday. We must spread the word until
                then. We do. We rest at the inn.</p>
            <p>Day 12 - Wednesday</p>
            <p>1000 gold is missing, the guards need swords. We will try to get them from the shops and smiths by
                Friday. We have to go to [Gereg]. He agrees to help us if we get him a spot on the Merchant's council.
                We
                must stop him. We owe him dearly. He must be arrested or killed. I want to find out what the [Ponat]
                worshippers feel about this. They feel neutral.</p>
            <p>Day 13 - Thursday</p>
            <p>Rest for Friday.</p>
            <p>Day 14 - Friday</p>
            <p>Head to council building. The coup succeeds bloodlessly, [Bert] sets up a judicial system. We must weed
                out
                the corrupt.</p>
            <p>EXPERIENCE:</p>
            <p>For using Command, clutch. Total: 4805 EXP. I am level three. Spend two weeks in town training.</p>
            <p>There is a Doh community forming. I will stay in touch. I plan on ending the graft once and for all with
                more Doh worshippers.</p>

            <h2>[Rel]'s Notes</h2>
            <p>Day 1: The 9 day voyage to [Wavethorn] is complete!
                It is a trade hub with 6 monarch-type elders. [Ponat] is
                the Fortress God whose followers inhabit the lighthouse. Wyvernfang are bandits held off by the [Ponat]
                worshippers.</p>
            <p>Districts of [Wavethorn]: Docks, Market,
                Residential, Commerce, Outskirts</p>
            <p>[Idona] is the patron god of Humanity.</p>
            <p>I met 3 well-meaning adventurers by the names of [Durchir] (a kindly, serious man), [Cormac] (a
                soft-spoken
                and soft-hearted young man), and Barnett (a very serious, but good person). We discovered that there was
                a string of disappearances in town, which we plan on investigating tomorrow. Our guide, Invae, is coming
                too.</p>
            <p>Day 2: Invae is gone! We were alerted by guards and brought before the council, but quickly acquitted. On
                our way there, we lost [Cormac]. After visiting the market district briefly, we were at an impasse.
                [Cormac]
                was taken into custody for evading arrest earlier in the day. This is pretty saddening.</p>
            <p>We, after a few errands, found Verinwort and went to the bar with him. He told us of a time he was
                kidnapped and taken to some ruins. When we took him home, 2 thieves jumped out the windows. We stopped
                them and subdued one. We found a demonic altar in his house and several corpses. We also found a
                notebook detailing the murders of Verinwort's uncle, Invae, and Daré who is scheduled to die in 2 days.
                Daré is the elder councilwoman so we waited there.</p>
            <p>Day 3: In the morning, we discovered Verinwort was dead. After pleading his case to the council, I and
                the others (aside from [Durchir]) are arrested. In jail, a shadowy figure breaks us out but then knocks
                us all unconscious. We awake in a different prison, which we break out of instantly.</p>
            <p>I come to, being smuggled back to the city, now a wanted man. How did it come to this? Who is
                orchestrating this? I'm going to try to appeal to the [Ponat] worshippers while [Cormac] recovers our
                items.
                However, it is too late and I have to rest. Never being a dull moment, [Bert] was delivered to me, drunk
                and alive! He woke up the next day and directed me to [Gereg], an underground leader of sorts. After
                some
                uneventful deliberation about council members, [Gereg] told me that the ruins I was unconscious in were
                actually a mausoleum accessible only by the founding family of this city, the Ordoss family. I paid him
                off through promise to rescue [Cormac] and [Alann] from prison. I truly hope they are safe. We know
                someone
                is trying to topple this city and I need to know who. I will not stand for the murder of innocents, no
                matter what. I may be weak, but I can use what power I have for the greater good.</p>
            <p>Council members:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daré - Hella old lady. Must save!</li>
                <li>[Bert] - Well-meaning youngster. Ally!</li>
                <li>Wright Belvie - Smuggles in poison and drugs from the elven tropics.</li>
                <li>Daniel Hillstop - Greedy old bastard, suspected of embezzling.</li>
                <li>Devon Welshire - Raised by barbarians, later became a scholar.</li>
                <li>Brae - Husband killed mistakenly by [Ponat] worshippers in Wyvernfang raid.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We now scheme on how to get the key from the Wyvernfang. Upon arriving at the mausoleum AFTER recovering
                our gear via [Alann], we encounter the same shadowy figure who captured us earlier. Upon losing him, we
                obtained access to the mausoleum through some regrettable methods... as long as it serves the greater
                good. While my comrades fought off bandits, I kept [Bert] safe. We entered the secret library type
                passage
                in hopes of saving Invae, although I fear it may be too late. I damn my weakness. I truly wish I could
                be something more than the voice of reason in this party. Alas, we did find her. I left her and [Bert]
                together for the time being while my allies and I clear out this dungeon. With little success, we
                escaped after a small run-in with ghost-types.</p>
            <p>The next day, we meet with [Gereg] again, this time showing him the note we found in the ruins. He
                confirms
                that this is Daniel Hillstop's handwriting, and so we now have solid proof of this. After we recovered
                an absurd amount of gold from the dungeon, we paid off the captain of the guard to stage a revolution.
                We broke even, and now plan to hold those responsible accountable. We have successfully instituted a new
                government for the people. I am pleased.</p>
            <p>I want to find new spells. I'm searching the library, looking for any magic users, or nearby ones/sources
                of magic. I spend my time studying this and such.</p>
            <p>I now know that everyone powerful/magical is heading east.</p>
