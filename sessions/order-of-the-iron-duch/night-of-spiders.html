            <h2>DM Summary</h2>
            <p>The party joins the Adventurer's Guild! Their first quest is to bring three purported outlaws to justice.
                These women have been seen impersonating Winged Blades of Wyaris and harassing Ponat worshippers. The
                party tracks down the individuals and brings them to jail in Wavethorn. After doing this, they hear word
                that other adventurers from the guild is in trouble in the ruins of Aranil. Naturally they investigate.
                Upon entering, the party is subjected to a horrifying spider illusion dungeon. Walls of spiders with a
                horrifying human form flowing through them chase the party down endless halls. After finding and slaying
                a witch in a crimson robe, they save the weakened other party. They return to Wavethorn to find out that
                the trial of the three that they had captured was an absolute bloodbath. Every single person in the
                courtroom was killed. Seeking these three once again the party heads to some coastal caves. They find a
                strange and magical experimentation lab set up. The place is abandoned, save for a man composed of
                spiders. As Durchir strikes this man with his sword, he disintegrates part by part into tiny spiders and
                crawls apart.</p>

            <h2>[Releas Neb]'s Notes</h2>
            <p>The adventurer's guild exists now! We went to check it out. I signed up instantly because this seems like
                a way to help people. Gawault is the leader of the Adventurer's Guild in Wavethorn. He comes from the
                east where he says it is a much bigger deal.</p>
            <p>We were tasked with finding out more about a dispute going on between local Ponat worshippers and
                worshippers of Wyaris. A wall-builder/Ponat guy, Willip, tells us about what's happening. New gods have
                appeared, and Ponat worshippers are being picked on. Wyaris is a member of the 3 Sister Goddesses.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wyaris, Lady of Swords - Chaotic Good vigilante types.</li>
                <li>Danaris, Lady of Death - Neutral</li>
                <li>Vaharis, Lady of Judgement- Lawful Evil Eliminators</li>
            </ul>
            <p>He suspects that someone wants to cause a holy war to rid the city of Ponat worshippers. When talking
                about the Ponat worshippers' original Fortress in the distan east of Othlorin, he said "Pure evil flowed
                out of the abyss and flooded our base". We return to HQ to report what we found, which is that they were
                not actual followers of Wyaris, rather strange looking leaf-covered people that threw fruit at them.
                After reporting this, a rivalling adventuring party (Riffen - Thief, Areth - Mage, Ochan - Elf)
                challenged us to catch the bounty on these women's
                heads.</p>
            <p>We got there first and performed our job reasonably well, we return 3 girls to HQ who are taken in on
                harrasment charges but the other party does not return. Since we saw them attempting to enter the
                mausoleum, we go there.</p>

            <h2>[Alann Barnett]'s Notes</h2>
            <p class="hp">HP: 13</p>
            <p>ONE MONTH LATER: OMAR 1 (One Month After Revolution)</p>
            <p>Kept tabs on temple they are preparing. One month ETA. Near the Hills of Hyadoon. We are going to go east
                with the Adventurer's Guild for our own reasons. I must become powerful if I am to bring order to this
                world and its people.</p>
            <p>We meet Gauwalt, the leader of this organization. Good man. We sign up. We become NEOPHYTES. Very
                well-organized organization. They have a President! Aereth. He's killed a dragon! He's cute ♡ | :). I
                like Gauwalt. This is unrelated.</p>
            <p>We are tasked with tracking down troublemakers who are looking to start a holy war with Ponat
                worshippers. We meet Willip, a person who worships Ponat. He is timid and I have trouble listening to
                him.</p>
            <p>We challenge another party to a contest over the bounty. We capture the rabble. Scared savages. Easily
                subdued. We bring them to HQ. Cormac is wrapped up in ethics over action. He will slow us down, but he
                has merit.</p>
            <p>We go to get the party from the tombs. For honor. We do it. It was scary. Runes, endless halls, spiders,
                the Man with the Grey Eyes.</p>
            <p>OMAR 3</p>
            <p>We learn of a mass murder comitted by the three women we captured. The captain tells me of two merchants
                murdered in a similar way on the DL. We go out the the location the women dissapeared.</p>
            <p>The SPIDERMAN kills Dúrachír. We are sad.</p>
            <p>OMAR 4? -</p>
            <p>We are back at HQ. I am Sad. We send his things back to the Angry Orchard. We rank up to rank 4 -
                PILGRIM. XP - 3450</p>
            <p>Downtime: Recruiting for Doh & Guild</p>

            <h2>[Cormac]'s Notes</h2>
            <p>I meet secretly with Gereg, wanting to join ranks with him as a thief. He asks for the hide of a Valley
                Viper. I should head to the northeast woods. I don't think Gereg cares about the hide; answers lie in
                the Northern Forest.</p>
            <p>3 Captured. Mind control?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helia - Works for the apothecary (Mix n' Mash)</li>
                <li>Elyn - Hunter</li>
                <li>Bridget - Fisherman, fishing on Forest's Coast</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="quoting">Thanks for the clothes. You've made it easier in choosing a sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Ordoss founded this town on the coast less than 3000 years ago. He was in a feud with the Khet family.
                The feud culminated at the battle of Fort Khondorul, where Helia tried to poison Sieg Ordoss but the
                affected rations were given to his son. Sieg retired his hammer.</p>
            <p>The abyss where the island crashed: Vokdjinn fell, lots of treasure. Crashed around 200 years ago.</p>
