            <h2>DM Summary</h2>
            <p>The party joins the Adventurer's Guild! Their first quest is to bring three purported outlaws to justice.
                These women have been seen impersonating Winged Blades of Wyaris and harassing Ponat worshippers. The
                party tracks down the individuals and brings them to jail in Wavethorn. After doing this, they hear word
                that other adventurers from the guild is in trouble in the ruins of Aranil. Naturally they investigate.
                Upon entering, the party is subjected to a horrifying spider illusion dungeon. Walls of spiders with a
                horrifying human form flowing through them chase the party down endless halls. After finding and slaying
                a witch in a crimson robe, they save the weakened other party. They return to Wavethorn to find out that
                the trial of the three that they had captured was an absolute bloodbath. Every single person in the
                courtroom was killed. Seeking these three once again the party heads to some coastal caves. They find a
                strange and magical experimentation lab set up. The place is abandoned, save for a man composed of
                spiders. As Durchir strikes this man with his sword, he disintegrates part by part into tiny spiders and
                crawls apart.</p>
