            <h1>Anash</h1>
            <p>A midsized agrarian city on the border between the Weinmere and Wavethorn. A busy road bisects it.</p>
            <p>Home town of Polly. Rel has visited Anash as well.</p>
            <h2>Government</h2>
            <h3>Mayor - Galdore</h3>
            <p>The town is run by the mayor, Galdore. Galdore is a peace-loving man, born and raised in Anash. He is
                very wise and serves as a sage, one of the only known in Othlorin. His husband perished over twenty
                years ago in service as a soldier to Count Jirakby's father. Galdore generally makes decisions
                single-handedly in town, sometimes calling upon trusted members of the community (unless orders are
                handed down by Count Jirakby). The townspeople have great faith in Galdore as he is gifted in
                divination
                and is notoriously even-tempered.</p>
            <h3>Count - Jirakby</h3>
            <p>Galdore answers to Count Jirakby, as Anash is within the Weinmere. Jirakby demands taxes in exchange for
                protection. In times of turmoil, he also demands Galdore's sagely abilities. Jirakby's men have a small
                barracks in town and serve as its guards. The count is generally hated by the townsfolk of Anash. He
                rules strictly and enacts laws that are out of touch with the values of the commoners. Some guards are
                liked as individuals, but by and large they are considered enemies unless proven otherwise.
                As a side note, the townspeople hate Count Jerushulo even more than they hate Jirakby. He's seen as a
                blubbering idiot and a needlessly brutish individual. They blame him for the current state of
                warmongering.</p>
            <h3>King - Gytha Ellyn IV</h3>
            <p>King Gytha has greatly surpassed her father's rule, uniting the shambles of the poor counties into a
                fortified kingdom. This isn't to say that things are going perfectly; her meteoric rise has incited
                fervor in the Counts, each striving to demonstrate dominance in hopes for favor from the crown. Because
                of this, the people of Anash begrudgingly honor her rule. Additionally, she is the current matriarch of
                the Ordoss bloodline (more on the Ordoss in the history section), making her a blood enemy of some
                townsfolk that carry Khet lineage.</p>
            <h2>Establishments</h2>
            <h3>The Shimmering Fox - Inn</h3>
            <p>The town's main inn, right in the center of town. Run by Aberdeen and Astoria Palleday and their daughter
                Minnie. A temporary home to merchants, priests, messengers, and the occasional adventurer. They provide
                middle-of-the-road accommodations - not luxurious, but certainly not terrible.</p>
            <h3>Tersi's Hammer - Blacksmith</h3>
            <p> Run by Tersi and her wife Agatha. Tersi is the forgemaster, while Agatha runs the business end of
                things. They largely make a living arming the local guard, merchant cart protectors, and Jirakby's army.
                Tersi is also an amateur storyteller, and has written 3 of the 24 books that can be borrowed from
                Supplies and More.</p>
            <h3>By the Board - Carpenter</h3>
            <p>Run by Martin Dobeth. He is married to Joba, the Wheelwright. They have four children.</p>
