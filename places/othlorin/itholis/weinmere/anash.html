            <h1>Anash</h1>
            <p>A midsized agrarian city on the border between the Weinmere and Wavethorn. A busy road bisects it.</p>
            <h2>Government</h2>
            <p>The town is run by the mayor, Galdore. Galdore is a peace-loving man, born and raised in Anash. He is
                very wise and serves as a sage, one of the only known in Othlorin. His husband perished over twenty
                years ago in service as a soldier to Count Jirakby's father. Galdore generally makes decisions
                single-handedly in town, sometimes calling upon trusted members of the community (unless orders are
                handed down by Count Jirakby). The townspeople have great faith in Galdore as he is gifted in
                divination
                and is notoriously even-tempered.</p>
