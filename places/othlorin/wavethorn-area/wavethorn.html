            <h1>[Wavethorn]</h1>
            <p>A merchant's city that is a major hub from Othlorin to the rest of the world. Head city to many local
                villages.</p>
            <p>Arrivalplace of [Releas Scarnewman], [Alann Barnett], [Durchir], and [Cormac].</p>
            <h2>Government</h2>
            <h3>The Three Councils</h3>
            <p>Three Councils (Judicial, Mercantile, and ) rule over [Wavethorn], with many members on each council.
                [Bert]
                Verinwort serves as an interpreter of the laws that make the framework of the government, as he created
                them. This system was put in place as a result of the [Wavethorn] Coup of 200 (OOTID - Sessions 1 and
                2).
                Notably, [Gereg] sits on the Mercantile Council since he was able to help supply the [Wavethorn] city
                guard
                for the revolution.</p>
            <h2>Establishments</h2>
            <h3>[Lucky Badger - Inn/Tavern]</h3>
            <p>The Lucky badger is a staple to the workers of the Docks Disctrict and those that work the Merchant's
                alike. Local bard [Bard Name] is known to frequent the Tavern and sing about current events.</p>
            <h3>[Remember Guy - Blacksmith]</h3>
            <p>Has done lots of smithing for Cosmo.</p>
            <h2>Religions</h2>
            <h3>Ponat, God of the Fortress</h3>
            <p>The city holds the Stalwart Thorn of the Sea, the fortified lighthouse temple and home to the worshippers
                of Ponat. Most of the townspeople embrace Ponat's presence in their town, especially the Achiel
                worshippers who respect Ponat for building the Fortress of the Gods where Achiel himself resides. The
                worshippers themselves protect [Wavethorn] faithfully and without significant or regular pay from the
                government.</p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>Town Founded - Age of the Ascension</h3>
            <p>Founded by the Rohei family in association with the Ordoss family following the extinction of the Orc
                Scourge. Heinrich Rohei was able to secure ownership of [Wavethorn] as a result of his aid against Helia
                Khet in the Battle of Khondorul Fortress.</p>
            <h3>Coup of [Wavethorn] - May 200 - Sessions 1 and 2</h3>
            <p>A newly formed, and frankly ragtag, group of adventurers overthrow the government through investigation
                of the corrupt members of the former council. Aided by finding the coffers of money embezzled by
                Councilor Daniel Hillstop and Councilor Brae Novan, the adventurers turn the money into a cash bribe to
                the city guard to remove the old council and enfore the will of the new Three Councils.</p>
