                [Bert]
                Verinwort serves as an interpreter of the laws that make the framework of the government, as he created
                them. This system was put in place as a result of the [Coup of 200].
                Notably, [Gereg] sits on the Mercantile Council since he was able to help supply the Wavethorn city
                guard
                for the revolution.</p>
            <h2>Establishments</h2>

                of [Ponat]. Most of the townspeople embrace [Ponat]'s presence in their town, especially the [Achiel]
                worshippers who respect [Ponat] for building the Fortress of the Gods where [Achiel] himself resides.
                The

                the city guard to remove the old council and enforce the will of the new Three Councils.</p>
