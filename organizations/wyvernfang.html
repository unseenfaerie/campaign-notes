            <h2>Basic Info</h2>
            <p>A syndicate of bandits that plague the [Wavethorn] region. They prey on traders leaving the city who are

            <h2>Areas of Operation</h2>
            <h3>[Wavethorn] - Bandits</h3>
            <p>Engaging in ambushes and raids on merchant caravans, the Wyvernfang are known for their guerilla tactics.
                Their leadership has also historically installed agents within [Wavethorn]'s government system.
                Wyvernfang bandits operate in small units, usually hiding out in the woods when not at their main base.
